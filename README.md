# LaTeX documents made by me, partially for Doral Academy students and partially for my own benefit

`Tests` is a list of tests that I've made for math club students.

`Other` is a list of non-math LaTeX documents that I've enjoyed writing! Topics include computer science, phsyics, english, and whatever else I don't feel like indexing into a dedicated directory.

`Handouts` are handouts for math club students. I hope to expand it to calculus topics.

`template.tex` is my template for basically all my documents

Eventually add:

Inversions Handout

Concurrency Handout

List of Cool Integrals
