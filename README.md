# LaTeX documents made by me, partially for Doral Academy students and partially for my own benefit

`Tests` is a list of tests that I've made for math club students. Hope to expand it eventually
`Other` is a list of non-math LaTeX documents that I've enjoyed writing!
`Handouts` are handouts for math club students. I hope to expand it to calculus topics.

Eventually add:

Inversions Handout

Concurrency Handout

List of Cool Integrals
